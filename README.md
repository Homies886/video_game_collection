# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

This is a Rails API backend intended to run with a JS frontend. The frontend can be found here: https://github.com/Homies886/js_video_game_collection

Use rake db:seed to seed database with a list of genres for the user to select from.

This app is intended for a user to add video games to a collection. The user navigates to the site and can see a list of games. The user can add games by inputing a title, description, image url, and selecting a genre. The user can also delete games from the list if they needed to. My intention is to continue to build on this and add update/edit functionality as well as user logins.

rails s will start the rails server
